# Healthcare Claims Analysis with Microsoft Excel

## Project Overview
This project analyzes healthcare claims data to extract meaningful insights into diagnosis patterns, claim frequencies, provider performance, and financial metrics. The analysis was conducted using Excel, leveraging its robust data processing and visualization capabilities to deliver comprehensive insights and interactive dashboards.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains detailed records of healthcare claims, including the following information:

Claims and Financial Data: Count of IDs, total price, and quantity of claims.

Diagnosis Information: Most frequent diagnoses and their occurrences.

Provider Data: Number of claims and total price categorized by provider.

Monthly Visits: Trends over time based on patient visits.

Turnaround Time: Duration between claim submission and processing.

## Data preprocessing involved:

Handling missing values.

Aggregating data for KPI calculations.

Structuring information for easy analysis and visualization.

Analysis Techniques
The analysis process involved the following steps:

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Removed redundant data entries.

Structured the data for consistency and accuracy.

Aggregated metrics for quick insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total claims, total price, and average unit price.

Analyzed top 10 diagnoses and claims to identify frequently occurring cases.

Analyzed monthly visit trends and provider-based statistics.

## Financial Performance Analysis:
Calculated total revenue and average price per claim.

Analyzed the financial impact of high-frequency claims.

Examined price distribution among providers.

## Provider and Claim Analysis:
Identified providers with the highest number of claims and revenue.

Analyzed the percentage distribution of claims across providers.

Assessed turnaround time to understand efficiency in claim processing.

## Visualization and Dashboard Creation:
Created interactive Excel dashboards to visualize:

Top diagnoses and claims

Monthly visit trends

Provider performance metrics

Utilized bar charts, line graphs, and pivot tables for in-depth analysis.

## Key Insights
Most Frequent Diagnoses: Identified the top 10 diagnoses to target for cost reduction strategies.

High-Impact Claims: Determined the most frequently claimed items, revealing areas of high cost.

Provider Performance: Highlighted providers generating the most revenue and handling the highest claim volume.

Monthly Trends: Uncovered patterns in patient visits, helping optimize resource allocation.

Turnaround Efficiency: Assessed the time taken for claim processing, guiding improvements in operational workflows.

## Visualizations
The project includes a variety of visualizations to support the analysis, including:

Bar Charts: To compare the frequency of diagnoses and claims.

Line Graphs: To visualize trends over time.

Pie Charts: To illustrate the distribution of claims among providers.

Interactive Dashboard: Combines key metrics and visual insights for easy exploration.
